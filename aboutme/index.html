    <p>I'm Ben. I am excited to learn at BYUi. Even though this is my first semester, I believe I have learned most of this classes topics in bootcamp, at home, and a highschool. I hope to use my extra experience to help others in my classes, so if anyone wants any help, feel free to talk to me after class. But be careful, I'm shy.</p>
