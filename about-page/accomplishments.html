          I'm Ben Michaelis. Actually my name is Benjamin Michaelis but I only
          go by Ben. I've done stuff. I don't really think much about my
          accomplishments, but I guess I've done a few cool things over the
          years. Of my accomplishments, pretty much all of them I had no help,
          so unless I say otherwise, you can assume that I alone am awesome.

          I wrote a program that shows a board of chess pieces in ascii, on
          which the pieces can be moved between spaces and captured.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote and rewrote the Tic-Tac-Toe game with turns, and win
          detection, on several different devices, one of which I made on a
          casio calculator, which I had to figure out how to code on my own,
          because there arn't any half decent programming tutorials for the
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've made a mostly functional computer in a particle simulation game,
          complete with a stack, a 10 by 5 character display, instruction
          counter, clock, registers, computer manual, and instruction set. Not a
          guide was followed, not a single part borrowed, so that I could
          understand absolutely every part of it.

          I'm a certified Amateure Radio Technician and I lead an army of
          dinosaures to war against a fortress full of weeping angels one time
          in a dream.

          I graduated highschool with a bunch of computer pathways completed,
          inluding game dev, java, and mobile app development, and I'm now in my
          first year of college.

          I learned all I could working in a fast paced, customer focused,
          mentally demanding job. I worked at a Dell Taco near home. I primarily
          focused on what I could do to improve the customer experience, and I
          greatly improved my social skills and confidence as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          My cat died, I consume social media, I have few friends, I have way
          too much confidence in my balance sometimes, and yet somehow I'm still
          alive. I blame my mom. She's too cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can make my own food! *Gasp* Food? Yeah Food! Like what? Rice,
          oatmeal, noodles, sandwiches, and even tacos! Whoa that's like... so
          awesome.
        </p>

          I can't think of anything else, so there is nothing to write here
          except goodbye. D:
