        <h1>My knowledge</h1>
        <p>
          I, Ben Michaelis, have learned a great deal of things for fun, and I
          consider myself a particularly curious person. Often determined to
          perfect something, or make something for my peace of mind, I will
          spend hours on hours working on a project. It's all too easy for me to
          disagree slightly with the color of an element, and slip into a period
          of constantly tweaking something until it's perfect. I'll go to great
          lengths to change one little thing, with only the promise that I'll
          like it more once I'm done. These perfectionistic tendencies coupled
          with my creativity, and free time have led me down many deep rabbit
          holes, many of which were fueled only by one simple question. But
          enough about how I learn, what about what I know?
        </p>
        <p>
          I played with boolean algebra. Bored by calculus, and to some degree
          running from it, I learned all I could about how to make equations,
          logic circuits, and truth tables, all for the sake of simulating the
          mechanisms of a computer in a game.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned about computer architecture. Figured out how the CPU does
          math, stores memory, and counts instructions, all because I wanted to
          make my own computer in a game like everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned programming concepts and applications while trying to make a
          mod for a game. The primary language was Lua, but I also learn a bit
          about C++ and about data structures like an array, stack, or
          linked-list.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't understand how classes worked in programs so I spent several
          day experimenting and researching the ins and outs of their
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to learn how to use a card design program to make my own card
          game, forcing me to learn many things along the way. I learned how
          spreadsheets could be accessed by a program. I learned many important
          elements of game design. And I learned how to create a game manual by
          making one.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="cool picture" /></p>
        <p>
          I saw some cool spreadsheet tips on youtube shorts, so I spent a few
          days learning about how to program things in a spreadsheet. I figured
          out how to make variables, tables, and expressions to process large
          amounts of data quickly, and display the results in all sorts of ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from all my learning in my free time, I also learned much from
          school. Whenever I could, I tried to understand the best way to solve
          problems, create plans, and search for answers. My objective in school
          was not just to remember the info for the next test, but to really
          understand it, so that I could apply it. My curriculum was pretty
          standard, so I tried to make the most of it, not to stand out, but
          because it was boring otherwise.
