         <h1>About Me</h1>
         <p>My name is Ben Michaelis, and I have lived for 19 years as of the time of this page's creation. That being said, I won't be writing about the me of today, rather, I wish to recall the me of the distant past, and connect the effect it has on me today.</p>
         <p>When young, about 4 or 5 years old, I slept on a bunkbed with my younger brother Sam. Not much one for words, being in some degree autistic, and being smaller than me, I naturally became his childhood bully. I could easily nagotiate, decieve, or force my way into a situation where I got all the computer time, all the show time, and all fun I could want, only stopped by the carefull watch of our Mom. My brother, equally enthralled by the games the computer offered, devised his own stratagies for more playtime.</p>
         <p>This battle happened daily after school, forcing me to be quick, calculating, and ruthless. The only thing stopping us from tearing out eachother's throats, was my moms constant kindness, and also loud momma bear anger.</p>
         <p>Growing older, my brother shot up in height, eventually surpassing me. This affected my respect for my brother, making me more kind, and less argumentative. Additionally, we got another computer, making battles for the computer few and far between.</p>
         <p>Always more interested in things than people, I read many books, played many games, created many things, and excelled in all school metrics besides any social metric. Because of my hobbies and because of my access to abundant resources, I created several games in my free time, hoping to bring the fun in my mind to the real world. School was so easy that for most classes I would completely ignore the teachers, or be engaged enough to stay ahead of the teachers and point out their mistakes if any. The games I created often were never played by anyone but myself, but some stuck with me for years, morphing and influencing my creative vision.</p>
         <p>Socially I have never been very active. Both my parents are more on the introverted side, and I was always more interested in my games, puzzles, and math problems. Naturally, I had almost zero friends, and I never started a conversation with anybody. Over time, everyone else got dramatically better at communication, and I got left behind. It was never graded, and my parents never guided my on that front, so naturally I developed social anxiety which prevents me from feeling like I have any friends, and makes me doubt my ability to have fun with anybody but my family.</p>
         <p>If I had a character sheet, you would see a massive natural intelligence, horrible natural charisma that is gradually improving, awesome dexterity, decent strength, meh constitution, and an oddly high amount of wisdom, but too much confidence in it. Overall I hope I'm unbalanced in the right way for the work I want to do.</p>
         <p>All that being said, there is much more about me to talk about, the two main things being my current knowledge, and the things I've actually accomplished. Read more with the links below.</p>
