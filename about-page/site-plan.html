      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Ben Michaelis, and I have lived for 19 years as of the time of this page's creation. That being said, I won't be writing about the me of today, rather, I wish to recall the me of the distant past, and connect the effect it has on me today.
        
        When young, about 4 or 5 years old, I slept on a bunkbed with my younger brother Sam. Not much one for words, being in some degree autistic, and being smaller than me, I naturally became his childhood bully. I could easily nagotiate, decieve, or force my way into a situation where I got all the computer time, all the show time, and all fun I could want, only stopped by the carefull watch of our Mom. My brother, equally enthralled by the games the computer offered, devised his own stratagies for more playtime.
        
        This battle happened daily after school, forcing me to be quick, calculating, and ruthless. The only thing stopping us from tearing out eachother's throats, was my moms constant kindness, and also loud momma bear anger.

        Growing older, my brother shot up in height, eventually surpassing me. This affected my respect for my brother, making me more kind, and less argumentative. Additionally, we got another computer, making battles for the computer few and far between.

        Always more interested in things than people, I read many books, played many games, created many things, and excelled in all school metrics besides any social metric. Because of my hobbies and because of my access to abundant resources, I created several games in my free time, hoping to bring the fun in my mind to the real world. School was so easy that for most classes I would completely ignore the teachers, or be engaged enough to stay ahead of the teachers and point out their mistakes if any. The games I created often were never played by anyone but myself, but some stuck with me for years, morphing and influencing my creative vision.

        Socially I have never been very active. Both my parents are more on the introverted side, and I was always more interested in my games, puzzles, and math problems. Naturally, I had almost zero friends, and I never started a conversation with anybody. Over time, everyone else got dramatically better at communication, and I got left behind. It was never graded, and my parents never guided my on that front, so naturally I developed social anxiety which prevents me from feeling like I have any friends, and makes me doubt my ability to have fun with anybody but my family.

        If I had a character sheet, you would see a massive natural intelligence, horrible natural charisma that is gradually improving, awesome dexterity, decent strength, meh constitution, and an oddly high amount of wisdom, but too much confidence in it. Overall I hope I'm unbalanced in the right way for the work I want to do.

        All that being said, there is much more about me to talk about, the two main things being my current knowledge, and the things I've actually accomplished. Read more with the links below.

      <h3>Knowledge</h3>
      <p>
        My knowledge. I, Ben Michaelis, have learned a great deal of things for fun, and I consider myself a particularly curious person. Often determined to perfect something, or make something for my peace of mind, I will spend hours on hours working on a project. It's all too easy for me to disagree slightly with the color of an element, and slip into a period of constantly tweaking something until it's perfect. I'll go to great lengths to change one little thing, with only the promise that I'll like it more once I'm done. These perfectionistic tendencies coupled with my creativity, and free time have led me down many deep rabbit holes, many of which were fueled only by one simple question. But enough about how I learn, what about what I know?

        I played with boolean algebra. Bored by calculus, and to some degree running from it, I learned all I could about how to make equations, logic circuits, and truth tables, all for the sake of simulating the mechanisms of a computer in a game.
        
        I learned about computer architecture. Figured out how the CPU does math, stores memory, and counts instructions, all because I wanted to make my own computer in a game like everyone else.

        I learned programming concepts and applications while trying to make a mod for a game. The primary language was Lua, but I also learn a bit about C++ and about data structures like an array, stack, or linked-list.
        
        I didn't understand how classes worked in programs so I spent several day experimenting and researching the ins and outs of their functionality.

        I wanted to learn how to use a card design program to make my own card game, forcing me to learn many things along the way. I learned how spreadsheets could be accessed by a program. I learned many important elements of game design. And I learned how to create a game manual by making one.

        I saw some cool spreadsheet tips on youtube shorts, so I spent a few days learning about how to program things in a spreadsheet. I figured out how to make variables, tables, and expressions to process large amounts of data quickly, and display the results in all sorts of ways.

        Aside from all my learning in my free time, I also learned much from school. Whenever I could, I tried to understand the best way to solve problems, create plans, and search for answers. My objective in school was not just to remember the info for the next test, but to really understand it, so that I could apply it. My curriculum was pretty standard, so I tried to make the most of it, not to stand out, but because it was boring otherwise.

      <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Ben Michaelis. Actually my name is Benjamin Michaelis but I only go by Ben. I've done stuff. I don't really think much about my accomplishments, but I guess I've done a few cool things over the years. Of my accomplishments, pretty much all of them I had no help, so unless I say otherwise, you can assume that I alone am awesome.

        I wrote a program that shows a board of chess pieces in ascii, on which the pieces can be moved between spaces and captured.

        I wrote and rewrote the Tic-Tac-Toe game with turns, and win detection, on several different devices, one of which I made on a casio calculator, which I had to figure out how to code on my own, because there arn't any half decent programming tutorials for the thing.

        I've made a mostly functional computer in a particle simulation game, complete with a stack, a 10 by 5 character display, instruction counter, clock, registers, computer manual, and instruction set. Not a guide was followed, not a single part borrowed, so that I could understand absolutely every part of it.

        I'm a certified Amateure Radio Technician and I lead an army of dinosaures to war against a fortress full of weeping angels one time in a dream.

        I graduated highschool with a bunch of computer pathways completed, and I'm now in my first year of college.

        I learned all I could working in a fast paced, customer focused, mentally demanding job. I worked at a Dell Taco near home. I primarily focused on what I could do to improve the customer experience, and I greatly improved my social skills and confidence as a result.

        My cat died, I consume social media, I have few friends, I have way too much confidence in my balance sometimes, and yet somehow I'm still alive. I blame my mom. She's too cool.

        I can make my own food! *Gasp* Food? Yeah Food! Like what? Rice, oatmeal, noodles, sandwiches, and even tacos! Whoa that's like... so awesome.

        I can't think of anything else, so there is nothing to write here except goodbye. D:
